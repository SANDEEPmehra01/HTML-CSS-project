# HTML-CSS-project

"I've developed an HTML project for an employee HR portal, featuring a sleek registration form with fields for name, ID, password, age, role, and joining date. I've also styled it using CSS, adding color, size, and font type, giving it a polished and professional look. Additionally, the project includes an employee directory, contact information, and office location pages for a comprehensive user experience."
